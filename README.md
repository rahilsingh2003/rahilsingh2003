## 🌍 A Little About Me

- I was born in **Fiji**, raised in **New Zealand**, and now live in **Sacramento, California**, that international background shaped my worldview and taught me to appreciate diverse cultures and perspectives.
- I currently work as a **medical scribe** at a local hospital. It’s helped me understand real-world user needs and develop the ability to work under pressure, both of which influence how I think about UX design.
- I’m passionate about **video games**, especially those that are either highly competitive or deeply story-driven. They inspire me creatively and reinforce my love for thoughtful, immersive design.
- In my free time, you’ll usually find me at the gym, I’m big on weight training and cardio as a way to stay focused and energized.
